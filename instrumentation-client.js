// Initialize Sentry on the client only if it hasn't already been initialized
// (e.g., by an automatic config loader). This prevents the runtime warning
// about calling `Sentry.init()` more than once.
// Client initialization is provided by the Next.js Sentry integration when using
// a `sentry.client.config.js` file. Do not call `Sentry.init()` here to avoid
// duplicate initializations â€” this file only exposes helper hooks.
